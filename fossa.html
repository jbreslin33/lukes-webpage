		<h1>fossa</h1>
<p>    A fossa has claws like like cats<br>
 a long tail and round ears<br> 
 although it shares some adaption<br>
 with cats, the fossa is closely related<br>
to the mongooses and civets.<br>
 It's coat is short,usually a rich brown<br>
 with a golden tinge, the fossa's tail makes<br>
 up about a half of a mammal's length !<br>
That extra long tail helps the fossa balance<br>
and jump from branch to branch.<br>
It has retractable claws like those of a<br>
a cat help it climb down a tree head first.</p>
